     I’m Madison Everett. I am currently working as a Project Consultant at Vanderbilt University. I'm a native Nashvillian and an alumni of Belmont University. In 2020, I graduated from Belmont with a Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. Soon after, I decided to start my career in Project Management at Vanderbilt University as a Project Consultant after realizing the passion that I have for helping people solve their problems with technology. Since then, I have helped manage 6 impactful projects within Vanderbilt’s Process, Solutions, and Implementation (PSI) team, one project, which includes the implementation of the new cross-campus Electronic Research Administration Saas Project, VERA, in just under 2 years of working in my position. Because of my growing passion and experience, I decided to obtain the Grow with Google: Project Management Certificate in order to not only gain more understanding of the ins and outs of this field, but to also prepare myself to obtain a PMI certification of my choosing. 
      So right now, I’m at a point where I feel ready to take my career to the next level so that’s why I’m currently looking for the next steps to expand my project management skills and continue challenging myself.
