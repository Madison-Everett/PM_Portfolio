    <strong>Role</strong>: Developer

    <strong>Length</strong>: 10 weeks

      <li>- NumPy</li>

<br>
  <p>
    <strong>Description</strong>: This project was developed during my 10 week internship at UBS. The goal of this project was to create a machine-learning model that could predict whether or not a financial trade would settle or fail. In order to create training data, I had access to one of UBS’s many trading databases that contained CID (Client Identifying Data) and several attributes that could contribute to whether or not a trade was going to settle or fail.

    In order to target which trades would fail, I first gathered info from the various subject matter experts around the office in order to pinpoint exactly where trades could go wrong. Secondly, I created a correlation matrix using Pandas and Matplotlib in order to see the correlation of attributes that lead to a failure. From there, I developed my machine learning model into a classification model using the Tensorflow Library and numPy and created my training and test data. This took about 4 weeks. On the first model run, the model performed at 40% accuracy, which was pretty low to start, but all models start somewhere. With longer training sessions, by the end of the 10 weeks, the model performed at 85% accuracy, which was an excellent improvement.
