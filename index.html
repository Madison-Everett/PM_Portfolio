                <p class="title is-5 has-text-white-bis">
                    I am currently a Project Consultant at Vanderbilt University. I’m a native Nashvillian and an alumni of Belmont University. In 2020, I graduated from Belmont with a Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. 
                </p>
                <p class="title is-5 has-text-white-bis">
                    Soon after graduating, I decided to start my career in Project Management at Vanderbilt University as a Project Consultant after realizing the passion that I have for helping people use technology to solve their everyday problems.
                </p>
                <p class="title is-5 has-text-white-bis">
                    Since then, I have helped manage six impactful projects within <a class = "has-text-warning-light is-underlined" href= https://www.vanderbilt.edu/aapsi/about_us/meet_the_team.php> Vanderbilt’s Process, Solutions, and Implementation (PSI)</a> team. One of the six projects includes the implementation of the new cross-campus Electronic Research Administration Saas Project, VERA, which I helped manage in just under 2 years of working in my position.

                <p class="title is-5 has-text-white-bis">
                    Because of my growing passion and experience, I decided to obtain the Grow with Google: Project Management Certificate in order to not only gain more understanding of the ins and outs of this field, but to also prepare myself to obtain a PMI certification of my choosing in the future!

            <p>This was a project that consisted of building an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model with the goal of being able to solve the puzzle <a class="has-text-warning-light is-underlined has-text-weight-bold" href="https://www.puzzle-dominosa.com/">Dominosa</a>, a Constraint-Satisfaction toy problem. In this project, I used various algorithms, such as Backtracking Search, Forward-Checking, Conflict-Directed Backjumping, in order to create a successful and efficient problem-solving model.  After a larger amount of testing, I came to the conclusion that the Backtracking Search algorithm with added heuristics performed more optimally and efficiently than a human player.

            <p>This project was developed during my 10 week internship at UBS. The goal of this project was to create a machine-learning model that could predict whether or not a financial trade would settle or fail. In order to create training data, I had access to one of UBS’s many trading databases that contained CID (Client Identifying Data) (which is one of the reasons why I do not have access to the repo &#128577;) and several attributes that could contribute to whether or not a trade was going to settle or fail. 
              <p>In order to target which trades would fail, I first gathered info from the various subject matter experts around the office in order to pinpoint exactly where trades could go wrong. Secondly, I created a correlation matrix using Pandas and Matplotlib in order to see the correlation of attributes that lead to a failure. From there, I developed my machine learning model into a classification model using the Tensorflow Library and numPy and created my training and test data. This took about 4 weeks. On the first model run, the model performed at 40% accuracy, which was pretty low to start, but all models start somewhere. With longer training sessions, by the end of the 10 weeks, the model performed at 85% accuracy, which was an excellent improvement. </p>

          <p>This project was an exploration in Text Mining comparing matrix decomposition methods, <a class = "has-text-warning-light is-underlined has-text-weight-bold"  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition">Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)</a>  and <a class = "has-text-warning-light is-underlined has-text-weight-bold"  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization">Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF)</a> to see which method performed better in summarizing a large collection of texts.  </p>
          <p>In order to perform this exploration, I used the Scikit-learn and Sklearn framework that contain dummy sets of text data as the corpus of text for the methods. In order to evaluate and compare these methods, I gathered the general topic extraction results, in addition to the results of the two above methods and displayed them in Word Clouds using MATLAB. As a result, it seemed that the NMF method performed similarily to the general topic extraction than SVD, which means that the NMF performs more closely to a human than SVD.</p>

          <p>These scripts are from the Data Migration phase of the VERA project. This phase consisted of pulling historical and current data from the current Grants and Agreement system and loading it into the new system using a SFTP server. My task was to pull all PDF files from the Agreement system in order to have them ready for the new system. I completed this task by creating SQL to pull the file names and unique file ids of the files that we needed. 
        </p>
        <p>This step had to be done first since the only way to pull the pdfs was through a custom built API that required a “get” containing the document id from the db and the bearer token. From there, I decoded the files using json and base64 and saved the pdfs in a folder system (“<a class = "has-text-warning-light is-underlined has-text-weight-bold" href=https://github.com/Madison-Everett/Python_Data_Migration_VERA/blob/main/Agreement%20Migration%20Code/For%20final%20copies%2004-27-2021.py>For Final copies___</a>" scripts) with the file names that I pulled from the db to prepare them for the new Agreements system. In addition to this, I also had to update a db table in order to keep the files organized for the import into the new system (“<a class = "has-text-warning-light is-underlined has-text-weight-bold" href=https://github.com/Madison-Everett/Python_Data_Migration_VERA/blob/main/Agreement%20Migration%20Code/filepath-04-05.py>filepath___</a>" scripts).  I performed this task over 8 months in batches since this process needed to be refined for go live in Oct 2021 and the PDF data was needed for UAT, which began in February 2021.</p>

This project was sponsored by the Provost of Research at Vanderbilt University and its goal was to combine the current Grants and Contracts systems (COEUS and PEER) into one comprehensive system with the help of our vendor, Huron Consulting Group. This project affected the entire Grants and Contracts community, which included around 500+ faculty and staff members. It also had over 50+ high impact stakeholders from across Vanderbilt University departments.

        <p>This project is Faculty Affairs related, similar to FIS. but focuses mainly on the faculty hiring, promotion, and tenure aspect. This platform allows for department admins and department chairs to designate a hiring/promotion process within the application for their particular department. This platform also allows faculty members to search appointments of faculty as well as set up and document faculty committee reviews as well.
        </p>
        <p>My role in this project consists of being the Product Owner/Manager for any updates or improvements that departmental admins or Faculty Affairs staff bring to our attention. After organizing and evaluating the changes, I communicate these updates to our vendor’s development team in order to update the system. </p>
